# NOTE: I suggest using blank passwords for all your operators.
#       Create backup names WITH passwords in case the biller goes down.

# This file is part of the MERVBot database collection.
# Changes made while the bot is running WILL be lost.

# Lines beginning with non-alphanumeric characters ('#', '$', etc) are comments

# Operators:
# This file is used for defining who has access
# to bot commands from inside the game.
# These people are called "operators" who are assigned
# passwords used with the !login <password> command
# to gain access.  I recommend erasing example
# operators above, before running the bot.

# Types of Operators:
# LVL Type           Description
# 0   Player         Requests information services
# 1   Limited        Player with some privelages
# 2   Moderator      Represents player interests
# 3   SuperModerator Manages moderators
# 4   SysOp          Represents staff interests
# 5   Owner          Changes internal bot settings
#...  (Etc)          Other ways to say "Owner"

# Operators.txt Format:
# Access level:Name:Password
# 2:Catid:Password  <- !login Password required
# 2:Catid:          <- !login Password NOT required

# Blank Passwords:
# A blank password means operator is granted powers upon entering the arena,
# and does not need to use !login unless his powers change while he is still
# in the game.

# White-space:
# White-space (' ') is ignored before and after colons (':')
# Ex. 5 : Catid   :   Password  is the same as 5:Catid:Password
