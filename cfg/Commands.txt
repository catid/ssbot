## Commands.txt reference ##
############################

# This file is part of the MERVBot database collection.
# Changes made while the bot is running WILL be lost.

# Lines beginning with non-alphanumeric characters ('#', '$', etc) are comments

# Aliases:
# This file is used as both a command reference and to define command aliases,
# or commands that do the same thing as other commands, with different wording.
# If you want to make "!AAAAARG" do the same as "!HELP", here's where you do it.

# Commands.txt Format:
# Command_Alias:Actual_Command
# Do not include '!' prefix in command alias/actual.

# Examples:
# editop:eop   <- !editop aliases !eop
# password:pw  <- !password aliases !pw

# Warning:
# Note that the aliases must become equivalent to some command
# or else they will not be processed as a commands.  Aliases
# cannot themselves be used as base command names.

# Something cool:
# If you want to disable a command for all access levels, you can do it here!
# Ex. kill:DISABLED

# White-space:
# White-space (' ') is ignored before and after colons (':')
# Ex. 5 : Catid   :   Password  is the same as 5:Catid:Password
